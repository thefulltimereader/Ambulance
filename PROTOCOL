RULES implemented in this validator:
- 1 min to go one block north-south, east-west
- the ambulances do NOT need to return ot the hosiptal they begin
- each ambulance can carry up to FOUR
- 1 min to load ONE person
- up to 1 min to unload FOUR people (however many <= 4, requires 1
min)

SAMPLE RESULT INPUT:
     P=Pickup 
     D=Drop off
     Each ambulance gets a global_unique_ID, also for people [index
     starts from 0]
     Everysingle time an ambulance is created, they are assigned a
     static location (FOR their hospital)
     	    i.e. if input of hospital(nmambulance) look like
	    	 ----
		 5
		 9
		 6
		 ----
		 There exists 3 hospitals with static loc (x1,y1),
     (x2,y2), (x3,y3), and there are 20 ambulances total (amb 0->20).
     
     Input starts with form "ambulance:"+AMBULANCE_ID(P or D) depending on Pick up or
     Drop-off, with its associated hospital's (x, y).
     	   i.e. in our example above, if hospital_id:2's location is
     (100,100), ambulance:10 will have (100, 100) following their id
     all the time.

     Then, the input is followed by the id and information of the
     people picked up OR dropped, depending on the P or D following
     the Ambulane ID.

     Amubulance:AMUBLANCE_ID:P or D (hosx,hosy) PERSON0_ID (px,py,ptime)
     PERSON1_ID (px,py,ptime) ...upto PERSON3_ID (px,py,ptime)
     
     EXAMPLE:
     Ambulance 1:P (45,32) 5 (84,26,95)
     Ambulance 1:D (45,32) 6 (64,30,74) 11 (56,26,80)
     Ambulance 3:P (45,32) 42 (29,42,67)
     Ambulance 10:P (59,68) 8 (68,57,52) 4 (2,3,40)
     Ambulance 1:D (45,32) 14 (66,47,58)
     ....

     DELIMITERS:
     All inputs other than the (x,y) location coordinates and :, ALL
     delimiters will be the white space.
     So
     Ambulance      1: P     (45,32)  5     (84,26,95)
     and 
     Ambulance 1:P (45,32)  5 (84,26,95)

     are the same.
